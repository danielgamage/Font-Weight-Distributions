## Building Data
if you'd like to fetch a new dataset, you must have a `config.js` file in the root. It should have a structure like this:

```
module.exports = {
  "token": "YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE"
}
```

You must [register an application](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens) with github to get your own token.
